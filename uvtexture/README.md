# uvtexture

This is an old framework that allows people to share textures in a central repository server, and a complimentary program that downloads those textures to their game client.

Application Code started 26 December 2008. Website scripting started 27 December 2008 and was created in tandem with the application.

This process was obsoleted when Uthervere created their [Resource Downloader/Texture Server(https://forums.utherverse.com/yaf_postst50746_The-Resource-Downloader-and-How-it-Changes-Everything---In-a-Very-Good-Way.aspx) on 26 November 2009 and asked us to upload all of our assets to their server.

# Requirements
