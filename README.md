## 2007 October 8 / First User Registration

A long, long time ago I registered a user called "kraqur". It had a MemberId of [91018546](91018546/91018546_google-search-profile-dates.pdf).

During this time I did a lot of blogging and documented my creation of two very important contributions:
- Quick Closet
- Porno TV
- Autorayter

per the [blog](91018546/blog.pdf) there were a couple dates to note:
- 2007 October 28 / RLC Outfit Changer
- 2007 November 7 / Porno TV
- 2008 April 23 / RLC Quick Closet v2
- 2008 April 26 / Autorayter

I was able to make a couple friends during this stretch:
- [patch2122](https://www.utherverse.com/net/profile/view_profile.aspx?MemberId=90659692)
- [4biden](https://www.utherverse.com/net/profile/view_profile.aspx?MemberId=91311133)

## 2008 November 11 / Second User Registration

For some reason (most likely the Autorayter) I was banned. I recreated a second user called "dakraqur"

A keen-eyed [murasaki_hime](https://www.utherverse.com/net/profile/view_profile.aspx?MemberId=90834244) found me outside of Night Candy, a club right outside of Transport, remembered that I wrote programs, and got me into Texture Distribution.

## 2008 November 19 / Third User Registration

For some reason (most likely "common" to the previous banned username) I was banned. I recreated a third user called "twizzlah"

## 2009 January 20 / UVTexture

I had taken Murasaki_hime's idea of "texture distribution", created the program and the storage. After that it gained huge traction across the Utherverse.

We had the domain [uvtexture.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20090709062557/http://uthernews.com:80/node/817) and a mirror upload on [Yetanotherpaper (archive.org)](https://web.archive.org/web/20090507195924/http://www.uthernews.com:80/node/817).

## 2009 February 11 / Legal Action

The domain adminstrator received a legal thread about distributing software. They wrote back that they didn't write the software, and that was the end of that.

This was also around when twizzlah got banned.

## 2009 May 21 / Fourth User Registration

For some reason (unsure at this point) I had to create a new profile. I was masquerading as a user called "Aortae", which had an unknown last name: Yurt.

This was an anagram of "Autorayter". I was getting sick and tired of changing my identity.

## 2009 May 31 / Purchase of uvtstyle.com

for $10.19 you can also be an owner of a domain name. Another user came and found me and proposed a "catalog" of sorts. Her Identity was [seasonsheart](https://www.utherverse.com/net/profile/view_profile.aspx?MemberID=92046962).

## 2010 Jan 5 / Launch of UVDeviant

For some reason we had to act fast after uploading all the textures to the texture server, and we did. We built a full-service catalogue and texture uploader for users.
