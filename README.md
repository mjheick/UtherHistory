## 2007 October 8 / First User Registration

A long, long time ago I registered a user called "kraqur". It had a MemberId of [91018546](91018546/91018546_google-search-profile-dates.pdf).

During this time I did a lot of blogging and documented my creation of two very important contributions:
- Quick Closet
- Porno TV
- Autorayter

per the [blog](91018546/blog.pdf) there were a couple dates to note:
- 2007 October 28 / RLC Outfit Changer
- 2007 November 7 / Porno TV
- 2008 April 23 / RLC Quick Closet v2
- 2008 April 26 / Autorayter

I was able to make a couple friends during this stretch:
- [patch2122](https://www.utherverse.com/net/profile/view_profile.aspx?MemberId=90659692)
- [4biden](https://www.utherverse.com/net/profile/view_profile.aspx?MemberId=91311133)

## 2008 November 11 / Second User Registration

For some reason (most likely the Autorayter) I was banned. I recreated a second user called "dakraqur"

A keen-eyed [murasaki_hime](https://www.utherverse.com/net/profile/view_profile.aspx?MemberId=90834244) found me outside of Night Candy, a club right outside of Transport, remembered that I wrote programs, and got me into Texture Distribution.

## 2008 November 19 / Third User Registration

For some reason (most likely "common" to the previous banned username) I was banned. I recreated a third user called "twizzlah"

## 2009 May 21 / Fourth User Registration

For some reason (unsure at this point) I had to create a new profile. I was masquerading as a user called "Aortae", which had an unknown last name: Yurt.

This was an anagram of "Autorayter". I was getting sick and tired of changing my identity
